# The cow
## by Andrei

There was a cow.

The cow got up and walked away.

It was afraid.

---

The crocodile continuted to stalk her with lustful eyes.

She stopped chewing when she realised her hooves are stepping into mud.

This is a swamp.

---

The cow panicked and tried to jump.

Cows cannot jump.

---

A crocodile ate a cow.
